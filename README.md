OpenISETL
=========

Scala/JVM implementation of the ISETL language.

About the project
-----------------

This is a toy project found on an old hard drive, quality and completeness is unknown.

About the implementation
------------------------

The code is compiled down to JVM byte code (using ASM), and then executed. Parsing is done using Scala's parsing.combinator package.

About the language
------------------

ISETL is a toy language, too. It has first class functions, closures with lexical scope, kind of array/list destructuring, and many other fun features.
